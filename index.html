          <a href="https://www.lithiumion-batteries.com">Smart Battery</a> claims to sell high quality Lithium-ion batteries. According to customer complaints, the company very rarely delivers a working product and is likely to disappear after payment is made. The owner, <a href="http://victor-harberson.com">Victor Harberson</a>, will go the extra mile to help you place your order and then he will go silent. He will make empty promises, ignore you, and get upset with you for inquiring about your purchase. You'll never receive your products, and you'll never recover your money.

                <i>We placed an order with Victor nearly 1 month ago for over $5000 in batteries. We were told that the batteries were in stock and promised next day shipment. For weeks we called Victor and heard the same story over again - that our batteries would ship next day "guaranteed". On one occasion we were told that we'd receive a tracking number in 20 minutes, but when we followed up over an hour later, we were angrily asked by Victor not to contact them anymore. We did not receive a receipt for our payment, and our requests for a refund have been ignored. Victor Harberson is a scam artist.</i>

They would not take a credit card and would not send their product until the money cleared in their account this being completed they did not call or email me any shipping information at all after over 20 attempts trying to get hold of somebody there (only twice someone actually answered) I left them voice mail every time. On the occasions when I actually talked to a person named [Victor] the first excuse was the hurricane and the next was let me call the warehouse and get your shipping information to you this afternoon that was 3 weeks ago and 20 more attempts to reach them with no answers. I have owned a business that has been in business for over 60 years and have never treated a customer like they have. I can not see how this business is not bankrupt or is just fraudulent.

                <i>I ordered 2 12V 18Ah batteries and a 2 track 12V charger from Smart Battery. I regret purchasing from this company, they were poor with communicating and never actually shipped the product after 3 weeks. They told us they will be giving me a refund and I have found other batteries since I need them right now. Along with these problems, here are some more. 1. The picture of the really nice building on the front page of the website is obviously fake and computer generated. 2. The front page claims that there is a same day shipping option, which is false. 3. The toll free number is an automated call that I'm convinced doesn't send you to a customer service rep and ends the call after one minute. Call this number instead, XXX-XXX-XXXX. 4. If you send them any emails, they will just ignore you unless you want to purchase. 5. The 'distributors' page on the website is empty and forwards you to a quick inquiry form, which they will ignore if you send it in. 6. The buy page on some products have a 'buy on amazon' icon, which is not linked and is useless. 7. The product on amazon and the smart battery page for the same product have different specs. 8. This company is a joke. Do not buy. Use McMaster-Carr instead.</i>

                <i>I checked the BBB I found they have an "F" rating and 56 complaints filed.
                  I my humble opinion this is not acceptable. I recommend a search on Google of "SMART BATTERY Better Business Bureau" then reading their history with the BBB before making a purchase decision.</i>

                <i>I contacted the owner, Victor, regarding warranty on my 1 year old battery that is dead and will not recharge. He did not ask questions and said " we will send you a new one to replace the failed one!
